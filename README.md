Task 3 – Vulnerability Scan Report (Using Nmap)**

Tool Used: Nmap 7.98

Target: Hidden (Local Windows Machine)
--
1. Objective

To perform a basic vulnerability assessment on my PC using the free tool Nmap, identify open ports, exposed services, and potential vulnerabilities.

---

2. Scan Command Used

```
nmap -sV IP Hidden
```

This performs version detection and identifies services running on open ports.

---

3. Scan Results

```

4. Security Analysis of Each Open Port

✔ Port 135 – MSRPC

* Used for Windows remote procedure calls.
* Attack risk: Remote code execution (historical worm vectors).
* Severity: Medium

---

✔ Port 139 – NetBIOS

* Used for file & printer sharing.
* Attack risk: Information leakage, SMB attacks.
* Severity: Medium

---

✔ Port 445 – SMB (Microsoft-DS)

* Used for Windows file sharing.
* Historically targeted by:

  * WannaCry
  * EternalBlue
* Severity: High

---

✔ Port 2869 – HTTPAPI (UPnP / SSDP)

* Used by Windows for network device discovery.
* Attack risk: UPnP vulnerabilities, information disclosure.
* Severity: Medium

---

❗ Port 3306 – MySQL (Unauthorized)

* MySQL service is running
* Nmap couldn’t authenticate:

  * Means password may be weak
  * Or MySQL is exposed unnecessarily

➡ Major issue if not intentionally installed

* Severity: High

---

❗ Port 3389 – Remote Desktop (RDP)

* RDP exposed on LAN
* RDP is frequently attacked (bruteforce, credential theft).
* Without Network Level Authentication (NLA), it’s vulnerable.
* Severity: High

---

# 5. Overall Vulnerability Summary

| Port | Service      | Severity | Risk Summary                       |
| ---- | ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 135  | MSRPC        | Medium   | Windows remote service exposed     |
| 139  | NetBIOS      | Medium   | Info leakage, SMB enumeration      |
| 445  | SMB          | **High** | Past major RCE vulnerabilities     |
| 2869 | UPnP HTTPAPI | Medium   | Exposes device info                |
| 3306 | MySQL        | **High** | Unauthenticated DB service running |
| 3389 | RDP          | **High** | Remote login surface exposed       |

---

# 6. Recommended Fixes

1. Disable SMBv1

WannaCry-style attacks target SMBv1.

Run PowerShell:

```
Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol
```

---

2. Close Port 139 and 445 if not needed

* Go to: Windows Features
* Turn off:

  * File and Printer Sharing
  * SMB 1.0 (if still enabled)

---

3. Disable RDP (Port 3389) if not required

Settings → System → Remote Desktop → Turn off
OR
Ensure:

* NLA Enabled
* Strong password
* Firewall limits access

---

4. MySQL – If you did NOT install it

Disable the service:

```
services.msc
```

Find MySQL → Stop → Disable

If you installed it intentionally:

* Set strong password
* Bind MySQL only to localhost (my.ini)

---

5. Block these ports on Windows Firewall

* 135
* 139
* 445
* 3306
* 3389

unless required.

---

7. Conclusion

The Nmap vulnerability scan revealed that several high-risk and medium-risk ports are open on the system, especially **SMB (445), MySQL (3306), and RDP (3389)**. These services can expose the system to unauthorized access, malware propagation, or brute-force attacks.
By applying the recommended fixes such as disabling unnecessary services, closing ports, and enabling security features, the overall security posture of the system can be significantly improved.
